#    If this is enabled, players will have the option to hear a bell play
#    whenever their name is mentioned in chat in addition to the message being
#    highlighted in green.
chat3.bell (Chatbell) bool true

#    If this is not set to 0, players within this range of each other will see
#    messages highlighted in blue to indicate that they are close.

#    If this is true, players can cause messages to be highlighted in red for

chat3.shout (Enable Shout Messages) bool true

#    When enabled, a /ignore chatcommand is added which allows players to ignore
#    chat messages and PMs from players which they have added (see /help ignore).
#    Non-ignorable players can be added with by granting the `ignore_override`.
#    This will prevent these players from being added to ignore lists and will
#    automatically remove them should they already exist. The server owner (as
#    defined by the `name` setting) cannot be ignored no matter what.
chat3.ignore (Enable Ignore Feature) bool true

#    When enabled, players can add a limitted number of alternate usernames
#    which chat3 will check incoming messages for in order to expand
#    highlighting. The max number of allowed alternate usernames can be
#    configured with chat3.alt_max (defaults to 3).
chat3.alt_support (Allow players to add alts) bool true

#    If chat3.alt_support is enabled, this will control the maximum number of
#    alternate usernames that each player is allowed to configure.
