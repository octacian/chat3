#    If this is not set to 0, players within this range of each other will see
#    messages highlighted in blue to indicate that they are close.
chat3.near (Near Highlight Range) float 12

#    If this is true, players can cause messages to be highlighted in red for

#    message, by default, with "!" (configurable with chat3.shout_prefix).
chat3.shout (Enable Shout Messages) bool true

#    The single-character prefix to cause messages to be highlighted in red for
#    all players and the chatbell to be played (if enabled). This setting only
#    applies if chat3.shout is set to true.
chat3.shout_prefix (Shout Prefix) string !

#    When enabled, a /ignore chatcommand is added which allows players to ignore
#    chat messages and PMs from players which they have added (see /help ignore).
#    Non-ignorable players can be added with by granting the `ignore_override`.
#    This will prevent these players from being added to ignore lists and will
#    automatically remove them should they already exist. The server owner (as
#    defined by the `name` setting) cannot be ignored no matter what.
